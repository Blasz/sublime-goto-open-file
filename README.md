##GotoOpenFile

Sometimes, if you are working on a small subsection of a particularly large project, Goto Anything might get too distracting.  GotoOpenFile brings up a quick panel that only includes opened files.

For files in the active group, the default keybinding is ctrl-shift-o (or cmd-shift-o).

For files in the entire window, the default keybinding is alt-shift-o.
